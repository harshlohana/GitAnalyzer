# GitAnalyzer

![Logo](./Logo/GitAnalyzer.png)

- A personal project built with HTML, CSS3 and other tools to search users and view their profiles on Github. Nothing serious.

- Feel free to open issues for questions/improvements!

**Technologies Used -**
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JAVASCRIPT Es6
4. FETCH API

What is Fetch Api
: The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
